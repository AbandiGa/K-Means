# K-Means

• Form my implementation I used C++ language.

• I Implemented the K-means using the codeblocks 16.01 IDE with MinGW (CGG\G++ compiler) and GDB debugger.

• I used the version that is compatible with windows 8 (64 bit).

• To execute the program you have to call the K-Means function:

K-Means (Input.txt, k, Num)

•Input.txt, the input file that contains the 2D data point.

•K, the number of clusters.

•Num, number of 2D data points in your input file.
